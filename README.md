Demo code that explores the integration between Drupal, Elasticsearch and Silex.

The `elastic/` folder contains a small custom Drupal module responsible for 
getting data from Drupal into Elastic.

The `silex/` folder contains a small Silex app that then connects to Elastic and returns
data from it. Remember to run `composer update` to update your vendors.
